# Netflix_Menstruation_Correlation
# Project Overview
Over the next few months, I’ll be exploring how my Netflix viewing habits align with my menstrual cycle. The goal is to see if my period affects what I choose to watch and whether the emotions, themes, or genres of the shows I consume impact my mood and overall menstrual experience. By tracking both my period and my daily Netflix choices, I hope to uncover patterns and gain insights into how media consumption and my cycle interact. I’ll record my period dates, log what I watch each day, analyze any correlations, and test hypotheses about their influence on each other. Ultimately, this project will provide a data-driven look at how entertainment choices and emotional well-being shift during different phases of menstruation.
# Objectives
Understand Viewing Patterns During Menstruation: Analyze how my Netflix habits (genre, duration, emotional intensity) fluctuate throughout my cycle. 
Identify Trends and Patterns: Determine if I tend to prefer certain types of shows on specific days of my cycle. 
Data-Driven Analysis: Use statistical tools to identify correlations between menstrual phases and media consumption. 
Personal Insights: Gain a deeper understanding of how my mood and preferences change during menstruation and whether adjusting my viewing habits could improve my well-being.
# Motivation
This project blends two personal interests: menstrual health and media consumption. Here’s why it matters:
Personal Awareness: Understanding my viewing habits in relation to my cycle can help me make more intentional choices about what I watch.
Emotional Impact: If certain types of content provide comfort or, conversely, cause distress during menstruation, I can adjust my viewing habits for better emotional regulation.
Data Science Application: This project gives me a chance to apply data collection, analysis, and visualization techniques to a real-world personal dataset.
# Dataset
Date: The specific day of the record.
Menstruation Status: Whether I was on my period that day (yes/no).
Netflix Titles Watched: The title(s) of the shows I watched.
Genre: The category of the show (drama, comedy, thriller, etc.).
Emotional Tone: The overall mood of the show (e.g., uplifting, intense, relaxing, sad).
Comfort Level: My self-assessed comfort or distress level during menstruation (on a scale of 1–10).
I will consistently record these details in an Excel spreadsheet or a data tracking app to maintain accuracy. Any irregularities due to unusual cycle patterns or external stressors will be noted.
# Tools and Technologies
For data analysis and visualization, I’ll use:
Python: For data preprocessing and statistical analysis.
Pandas: To organize and manipulate the dataset.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: To visualize trends and correlations.
SciPy: For statistical tests and correlation analysis.
# Analysis & Plan
# Data Collection
Log daily Netflix viewing habits and menstrual data in a structured format.
Maintain consistent tracking of mood, comfort levels, and other qualitative factors.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Use visualizations such as bar charts, time series plots, and heatmaps to explore correlations.
# Hypothesis Testing
Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant relationship between my menstruation and Netflix viewing habits.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Menstruation influence the type of Netflix content I choose to watch.
# Trend Analysis
Compare mood fluctuations with content themes to determine if certain genres have a positive or negative impact on emotional state.
# Conclusion
By the end of this project, I hope to answer the following questions:
- Do I gravitate toward specific types of content based on my menstrual phase?
- Does watching certain genres impact my mood differently depending on my cycle?
- Can I use this data to optimize my media consumption for better emotional well-being?
This project isn’t just about tracking Netflix habits. It’s about using data science to better understand personal behaviors and their psychological influences. Through structured analysis, I aim to uncover insights that will help me make more intentional entertainment choices for improved comfort and well-being during menstruation.
